What's needed
-------------
- GTK+ 1.1 or higher (http://www.gtk.org)
- recent C++ compiler (for example, GNU C++ 2.90 or higher)

How to install
--------------
1. ./configure
   options include:
   --prefix=DIR           installation path prefix (defaults to /usr/local)
   --bindir=DIR           directory where the gtris binary will be installed (defaults to PREFIX/bin)
   --with-gtk-prefix=PFX  prefix where GTK is installed (configure will try to determine this on its own)
   For a complete list of available options, enter `./configure --help'.
   In most cases, you shouldn't have to specify any options at all.
2. make
3. become root (if necessary)
4. make install

hscores.bin is a sample highscores file.
